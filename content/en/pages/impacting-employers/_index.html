        <p>The OpenClassrooms mission is two-fold: Make Education Accessible means equipping individuals with up-to-date competencies and skills, but also fostering career progress and opening new professional perspectives to people from all backgrounds - especially to those who, for one reason or another, may encounter difficulties when looking for a job. </p>

        <p>While the apprenticeship model itself is effective in creating learning and career advancement opportunities, access to apprenticeships remains challenging for both employers and prospective apprentices. In some countries or regions, apprenticeships may not exist at all, or may be limited to blue-collar jobs. In other regions where the model is prevalent, administrative obstacles still complicate access.</p><p>In France, 44% of apprentices have encountered difficulties in finding a suitable position, while 34% of surveyed employers have opted to stop recruiting apprentices due to sourcing or administrative challenges. </p><p>To facilitate access to the apprenticeship talent pool for employers, OpenClassrooms has developed a seamless recruitment process by creating a thoroughly automatized, 100% online talent marketplace. Employers looking for apprentices now have direct access to an online platform with a large pool of candidates. Similarly, candidates have the ability to apply with just a few clicks, streamlining the entire process. </p>

        <p>Offering an easy and straightforward access to a diverse pool of candidates is an important aspect of accessible education. Another crucial step is to ensure that employers also have access to the right competencies when recruiting candidates.</p>

        <p>In that perspective, OpenClassrooms advocates for a shift towards skills-based hiring, rather than relying solely on credentials and diplomas in recruitment practices. According to a large survey conducted by Generations among 1,325 employers in Europe, the United States and South America, employers who opted to recruit based on skills rather than diplomas experienced a 58% increase in the number of applications. Additionally, 84% of employers reported no difference between individuals recruited based on skills and those recruited based on diplomas.</p><p>One of the key pillars of the OpenClassrooms mission is to provide access to education and employment to a more diverse and enriched pool of individuals. As a result, thanks to OpenClassrooms, employers gain access to competencies and experiences that were previously difficult to source and hire. </p>

            <p>After transitioning from a nail technician to an apprentice at Merck, I am now a Central Planning Support Specialist and am moving towards the role of an apprenticeship ambassador. Since my apprenticeship at this company, I have developed various skills in SEO, campaign strategy, project management, budget allocation, and email marketing, while also learning to better manage my anxiety and build confidence. My apprenticeship at Merck was a professional turning point, allowing me to significantly contribute to creating a shadowing program for new apprentices. This experience has transformed my career and strengthened my commitment to continuous learning and my company's success. </p>

Since September 2023, I have been an apprentice at Société Générale, working on an internal application for the control and compliance department. My mentor, who is sensitive to inclusion, has helped me collaborate with the disability mission for accommodations related to my autism, improving integration and comfort within my team. This experience has been crucial for my well-being and professional growth.</p>
