        <p>Every year, we revisit our mission statement: <i>Make Education Accessible</i>. Not to change it, but to consider how to best implement it. We crafted this mission to guide us, yet annually, we must reconsider the objectives that will actualize this statement. This marks our fifth mission report, summarizing our endeavors to breathe life into the mission alongside a set of objectives defined by our mission committee.<br></p>

        <p><b>→ Quantitatively</b><br>to reach and maintain a minimum proportion of 70% of our students belonging to one of these categories.</p><p><b>→ Qualitatively</b><br>to launch a communication campaign to deconstruct stereotypes about career changes to attract more atypical profiles to the tech industry.</p><p>Both of these goals were achieved. Quantitatively, in 2023, 75% of our students belonged to at least one of these priority categories. Qualitatively, a major communication campaign was deployed on social media with four video portraits of our students on the theme of overcoming mental barriers related to disability, age, education level, and gender stereotypes. The redesign of our admission funnel also allowed us to create a personalized process to recommend training and funding options to candidates.<br></p>

        <p>After four years dedicated to making education accessible to these five priority categories, the Mission Committee has observed that the initiatives implemented by OpenClassrooms have effectively contributed to facilitating access to education for these students. This access is now structurally and sustainably facilitated.</p><p>With that key learning in mind, the mission committee reconsidered what it means to make education truly accessible. They found that despite overcoming the specific barriers to education, our underserved students still faced obstacles to employment. Consequently, the Committee decided to refresh its approach with a deeper focus on 2 categories and evolving our impact measurement.<br></p>

OpenClassrooms can and will contribute to helping more students with disabilities access skills that will enable them to gain stable employment. This category used to be one of the five underserved categories, and we made the decision to elevate it as a main focus.</p><p>Our objective is to provide all our students with disabilities access to a mentor trained in disability management and a contact at OpenClassrooms who is also trained in disability. Additionally, we aim to deploy a strategy to improve funding to accommodate the necessary adjustments for students with disabilities.<br></p>

For these two groups, we also aim to deploy wide-reaching communications featuring role models from these categories to work on representations and facilitate identification.<br></p>

      2. Evolving our impact assessment: This methodology will focus less on the number of people we reach (how many underserved students do we serve, and how much growth we generated), but rather on the depth of the impact we have on each individual. In other words, our goal will be to understand how OpenClassrooms is able to positively impact the life of every student by making education accessible to them.

        <p>As a result of this new approach, this report is work in progress. We’re still reporting against the five underserved categories we have been using in the past, but we have added our two new areas of focus. Additionally, we are experimenting for the first time with a new Impact calculation model that will be updated in 2025 as we learn more in the future.<br></p>

        <p>The acknowledged advantages of apprenticeship for both parties, coupled with the chance to connect students with employers on our platform, prompted a change in our priorities. We are now dedicated to making education accessible by effectively pairing apprenticeship candidates with employers. </p><p>This is why a considerable amount of effort has been invested in building the OpenClassrooms talent marketplace (for employers) and the job board (for apprenticeship candidates).<br></p>

        <p>This strategy is also applicable to employers who are looking to hire full-time employees but are struggling to find suitable talent. Consequently, they can participate in the training effort through alternative methods, such as the POE <i>(Préparation Opérationnelle à l’Emploi)</i> program in France, which is a 'train then hire' type of initiative. OpenClassrooms is actively exploring these opportunities in parallel.<br></p>
