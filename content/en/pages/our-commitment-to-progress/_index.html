        <p><b>We have begun collecting more data from our free users, particularly regarding their career outcomes. However, there's room for improvement:</b></p><p>→ We can delve deeper into understanding our free users, including their demographics, learning objectives, and employment status.</p><p>→ We should highlight our free content impact: OpenClassrooms offers all courses for free under a Creative Commons license, a unique aspect of our platform. Yet, we need to better communicate the impact of our free courses.</p><p>Enhanced insights will enable us to tailor our free content more effectively, maximizing positive outcomes for all users.</p>

        <p>Over the past few years, we have made lots of improvements to our student data collection before they start their training. We now possess meaningful socio-demographic insights and a clearer understanding of our students' aspirations, reflecting satisfactory data quality in this regard.</p>

        <p><b>However, upon graduation, our data collection gets more challenging.</b></p><p>Only 25% of graduates share salary information, often in ranges rather than specifics. To accurately report job placement rates and salaries, we must amplify our data collection efforts. While progress has been made, completing and implementing this process for all graduates is crucial.</p>

        <p>This year, we aim to strengthen ties with our employer partners through increased engagement, fostering ongoing dialogue about their needs, challenges, and aspirations. We’ve already made a significant step in that direction by onboarding 2 new members in our Mission Committee who will carry the voice of public and private employers. </p>
